## [ERA](https://www.era.aero/en)

ERA (a member of OMNIPOL group) is a leading company in multilateration, multistatic surveillance, and reconnaissance technology. Unrivalled experience in passive surveillance sensor development provides ERA with unique know-how to deliver comprehensive solutions for global markets. It develops, manufacture and implement mission-critical systems for military and civil purposes.
ERA made air traffic control history when deploying the first multilateration system and introducing gate-to-gate surveillance.
ERA has brought to the world a novel passive medium range surveillance sensor category called Passive ESM Tracker (PET)  for defence and electronic warfare purposes - which is today in its 5th generation known as VERA-NG - tailored for air, maritime and land target surveillance and reconnaissance. Company heritage and global scene experience in passive EMS/ELINT helped ERA to bring another category of Over the Horizon Direction Finding (OTH DF) long-range sensor, in its 2nd generation called PLESS.
Mentioned sensors let grow a broad ecosystem consisting of sensors’ performance prediction and evaluation tools and data mining tools together with a full virtual EW scene simulator to help military intelligence.
Over last 3 decades, ERA has reached number of more than 160 installations, deployed in over 68 countries on 5 continents with 24/7 operations fulfilling demanding customer requirements. Nevertheless, more important than given number of references is the experience ERA achieved and lessons learnt during implementation of our solutions. The company intends to continue introducing new technologies to adapt to tomorrow´s challenges.

## [VERA-NG](https://www.era.aero/en/military-security/vera-ng)

Passive Surveillance ESM Tracker (PET) VERA-NG is the most advanced Passive Surveillance System utilizing the multilateration Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) principle. 
The unique system is designed for detection, localization, tracking and identification of the air, ground and naval targets as well as exceptional pulse and continuous wave signal analysis.
VERA-NG supports cross-border, long-term and long-range surveillance without alerting neighbouring nations. The system emits zero electromagnetic energy making it ‘invisible‘, i. e. it sees without being seen. It also provides strategic ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) information to collect, process and evaluate the ESM data for reference database.
VERA-NG = 6 decades of pioneering in the field of passive radiolocation adapted to face modern threats.

## [PLESS](https://www.era.aero/en/military-security/pless)

Passive Long-range ESM Surveillance System (PLESS) is a passive Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Direction Finding (DF) system developed by ERA. This direction finding system can detect, locate, identify and track air, land and naval targets with a focus on slow-moving or stationary platforms. The system processes signals from radars, jammers and datalinks emitting in a frequency band from 100 MHz to 18 GHz.
Using the unique passive detection technology by ERA, the PLESS direction finding system provides a covert mode of operation, ideal for long-term cross-border and maritime surveillance. Thanks to the utilization of tropospheric reflectivity properties, the PLESS direction finding system can see targets located even beyond the radio horizon.

## [MSS-5](https://www.era.aero/en/air-traffic-management/mss-5)

MSS-5 is the 5th generation of the Multilateration Surveillance System (MSS) tailored for Air Traffic Management combining proven multilateration and ADS-B technologies. The system provides accurate real-time localization, tracking and identification of all objects equipped with transponder: at the airport surface, in TMA and en-route. The system withstands all weather conditions and is suitable for any terrain profiles.
